In this second blog, I am going to share what I got during these days after studying c++ as a beginner. At the beginning stage, I thought learning c++ should be easy since the programming concepts behind it are so similar to Java, but when I am learning more detail about it I realized that it would take me a while to get used to the way that how to run a c++ program. However, it is good to keep learning new things as a developer. Now, let me introduce 3 important things you must to know about c++ as a beginner!

## General idea of C++
[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) is a general purpose middle level using object-oriented programming language. Even though it was developed in 1979, it is still one of the most popular programming languages in the IT industry. One reason is that this language can have a control on direct manipulation of hardware so that it can increase the performance of the program, like allocate the memory resources and after the data structure is not going to use the programmer can deallocate the resouces. Another important reason is that there are still hundreds of thousands of programmers using C++ to develop a lot of interesting and cool programs, which drives C++ keeping moving forward to accomadate the change of Information Technology.
